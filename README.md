# SimpleWordGuessingGame

# Introduction
In this game the user provides a list of words to the program. The program randomly selects one of the words to be guessed from this list. The player then guesses letters in an attempt to figure out what the hidden word might be. The number of guesses that the user takes are tracked and reported at the end of the game.


See the write-up for CSE 1223 Project 11 for more details.


# Prerequisite
The word list can be saved in a txt file. When the user input the file name, it needs to be the full path.
